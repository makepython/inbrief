# In brief explanation for developers, IT and tech managers.

This repo is the result of my growing frustration at the current practice of many tech sites of
filling their main page with marketing rather than clear simple explanation of what their product does.
After the countless "enterprise automation platform for disruptive cloud innovation" I decided that wikipedia 
was my first stop to understand "what is this thing". Yet it's still not enough.

This is a curated, restricted collection of slides. They must be short, sweet
and to the point. The slide template is provided here. Both companies and individuals
are welcome to create the slides, but they eventually must comply with the spirit and the
format of the template.
